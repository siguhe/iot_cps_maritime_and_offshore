\section{Method}

\subsection{Internet Service Provider and IP ranges} \label{sec:isp_method}
Internet Service Providers(ISP) are the organisations that connect people and companies to the internet. ISP charges money to deliver internet connection, and most people have a subscription. While a lot of ISPs are generalized, and deliver the internet to both private and organizational customers, others are more specialized. 
IPv4 addresses are 32 bit, meaning they can range from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255. The IPv4 addresses are sold to organizations, for them to distribute further. For example, an Internet Service Provider(ISP) will give IPv4 addresses to the customers while they use their subscribed internet connections. This distribution of IPv4 addresses to organizations is illustrated in \cref{fig:ipv4_map}.

\subsubsection{Autonomous System}
One or more CIDR blocks that is owned by an organisation and has a single defined routing policy is called an Autonomous System(AS). A typical example of an organisastion that owns an AS, is an Internet Service Provider(ISP). TODO: reference https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1930
The AS are registered with unique identification numbers. Online tools, like \href{https://hackertarget.com/as-ip-lookup/}{\textbf{Hackertarget AS-IP lookup}} \cite{asip_lookup}, makes it possible to find the parent AS of an IP address. Then the rest of the IP addresses belonging to the same AS can be found. This is done by using the Shodan "net" filter, which will filter CIDR blocks. The same way as in \cref{sec:isp_method}, for this method to work, the AS must be for a purpose within the project constraints.


\subsection{Reverse IP geolocation}
When Regional Internet Registries (RIR) give IP addresses to organizations, they also register contact information on the IP addresses. A part of this information is a location, specifying a country and city. Some data providers claim that the country accuracy is between 95\% and 99\%, while the city accuracy is between 50\% and 75\%.\cite{geolocation_acc}With accuracy poor, it is not possible to decide if an IP address is within the constraints by using its IP geolocation. The information returned by the one of the RIRs can be seen in \cref{fig:RIPE_NCC}.
Shodan have a filter for the location. This filter can also filter by latitude and longitude. However, I have not been able to find any information on how Shodan gather this information. \todo{Er det innafor å seie "I have" her?} 
Because of these uncertainties, IP geolocation can not be conclusive for finding devices within the constraints. However, by reversing the technique, it would be possible to narrow down the selection of IP addresses by first defining an area. Shodan can use the filter "geo:latitude,longitude,radius" to filter on addresses based on location.

With many major seaports, like Rotterdam, Antwerp and Hamburg, the North Sea has a lot of marine traffic. The sea also has a lot of offshore oil and gas fields; Ekofisk, Sleipner, Forties and Valhall, to mention a few.\cite{oil_field_lists} With this much activity within both constraints, the marine and offshore industries, a lot of things in the area have to be connected to the internet. To test if the IP geolocation services of Shodan could detect devices connected to the internet, a large area of the North sea was chosen: a circle with 270 km around 56\degree24\textquotesingle00.0N 3\degree00\textquotesingle36.0E, as seen in \cref{fig:geolocation}. To use Shodan to find devices within this area, the command \cref{lst:geolocation_sea} was used. As seen in the output from the command, no devices was found within the area.

\section{Problems}
\subsection{NAT}
Due to NAT connecting devices to the internet trough a single router, Shodan will only scan the outer NAT routing device, and not the devices behind the NAT. NAT is not always used for getting more IPv4 addresses. Sometimes it is used purposely to hide IPv4 addresses from the public internet.
