\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

\subsection{Background} \label{sec:background}
With a higher than ever number for devices connected to the internet than ever\cite{iot_stats}, more devices are vulnerable than ever. Many do not want an wireless lock on their house, since there is a chance it can be hacked by malicious parties. The lock must of course be secure and resistant to attacks, but it is hard to make something a hundred percent secure. The same challenge is even more important for industrial systems, where loss of money, damage to the environment or even loss of life can be consequences of system failure. There are already many examples of cyber-attacks on industrial systems, for example STRUXNET\cite{struxnet}, a computer worm that infected an Iranian nuclear facility. 
As with other industries, the marine and offshore industries are connecting more parts of their Cyber-Physical Systems(CPS) to the internet to improve their efficiency. While a lot of the Cyber-Physical Systems connected to the internet are well maintained and secure, many other are vulnerable. This is most often because the CPSs are not set up properly or run outdated software. Other than this, it is a "fact" of statistics that if a quantity Cyber-Physical Systems are connected to the internet, a portion of these will be insecure. 

IEC62443 describes preliminary recommednations and guidance for the use of cybersecurity technology and countermeasures. To stay as secure as possible, the industries should apply these measures.\cite{IEC62443} Among other things, it spesifies that firewalls should be added to systems that have the ability to "[Filter] IP-addresses on the outside allowed on the inside and vice versa". And filter "[ports and] applications allowed for communication". In other words, only devices that have a good reason for beeing connected to the Internet should be connected. 

\subsection{Objectives}
To explore the extent of this challenge, the first step is to identify how many CPSs can be reached. The goal is to list methods to discover Cyber Physical Systems in the maritime and offshore industries, and map how many of said systems can be discovered. From this the constraints are formulated:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The device is part of a Cyber Physical System(CPS)
    \item The device is connected to the internet
    \item The device is part of either the maritime or offshore industries
\end{itemize}
Since all publicly available devices can be found quite easily, the difficult part will be to recognize devices within the constraints.
Open-source intelligence(OSINT) is utilized to find these CPS. The OSINT search engine \href{https://shodan.io}{\color{blue}{Shodan}} is a popular search engine for enumerating Internet-connected systems, and will be used as the main reconnaissance tool of this project. 

\subsection{Limitations and assumptions} \label{sec:limits}
In \cref{sec:ipv6} it is assumed that industries in the offshore and maritime industries will not use a significant amount of IPv6. This is based on the findings from when this report is written, and the situation will hopefully change in the coming years. However, due to this, IPv6 was not investigated as thoroughly as IPv4.
Shodan is used as the main OSINT tool in this report. Any shortcommings of this tool will also affect the work of this project.
There are other tools available as well. Some of them has the same functionality as Shodan, like \href{https://censys.io/}{\color{blue}{Censys}} and \href{www.zoomeye.org}{\color{blue}{ZoomEye}}. Other tools, like the Traceroute tool used in \cref{sec:traceroute}, covers functionality that Shodan do not. There is many available OSINT tools available, and while Shodan was assessed to be the most fitting to this project, parts of it might be easier or more efficient to do with other tools. Tools not mentioned in the report were either not found or evaluated as not relevant.
Honeypot technology is to make a computer pretend to be another device. This is often done to do statistics on atempts to access the impersonated systems are done. This method is quite popular for use on CPS, and during the research of this porject, multiple other articles were found that set up honeypots as part of their research.\cite{bodenheim_butts_dunlap_mullins_2014}\cite{ICS_shodan_article} There is therefore a chance that some of the devices found by Shodan is in reality fake. Shodan has a method for identifying honeypots, but it is not foolproof.


\subsection{Research approach}
As the main goals for the project is to find methods suitable for identifying devices within the constraints, and to use these methods to identify how many devices can be found. The first step will be to get familiar with the Open-source Intelligence tools useful for the purpose of identifying and analyzing devices connected to the internet. Then research will be made to see what methods already exist. These methods will be tested with the constraints. Then the student will consult the supervisors from both DNV-GL and NTNU for thoughts on the methods found, and for ideas for new methods. Changes will be made to the old methods according to the feedback. Then both the old and the new methods will be tested again. After this, the student will again look for new methods to try, completing the loop as illustrated in \cref{fig:workflow} This process will be repeated until the interested parties are satisfied.
Articles for the research was mainly found by using the search engines Engineering Village\cite{engineering_village} and Google Scholar\cite{google_scholar}. During the research, however, it was found that some OSINT techniques was easier to find in online blogs. These were found by utilizing the DuckDuckGo internet search engine\cite{ddg}.

\subsection{Definition of important terms} \label{sec:definitions}
\subsubsection{Cyber-Physical Systems(CPS)}\label{sec:cps}
This project will rely on the definition of CPS from \textit{Conceptualizing the key features of cyber‐physical systems in a multi‐layered representation for safety and security analysis}.~\cite{guzman_wied_kozine_lundteigen_2019}
This artilce defines Cyber-Physical Systems(CPS) as "engineered systems that integrate information technologies, real‐time control subsystems, physical components, and human operators to influence physical processes by means of cooperative and (semi)automated control functions." CPS also has the three key features:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Real-time feedback control of physical processes through sensors and actuators  
    \item Cooperative control among networked subsystems,and
    \item A threshold of automation level where computers close the feed-back control loops in (semi)automated tasks, possibly allowing human control in certain cases. 
\end{enumerate}
This defines CPS as a broad term, and examples can be everything from the control systems at offshore platforms to an electric car. 

\subsubsection{Open-Source Intelligence(OSINT)}\label{sec:osint}
Open-Source Intelligence(OSINT) is defined by the American Office of The Director of National Intelligence in their Intelligence Community Directive as: "[Intelligence] produced from publicly available information that is collected, exploited, and disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate audience for the purpose of addressing a specific intelligence requirement."\cite{directive_301} This directive also defines Open Source Information as "Publicly available information that anyone can lawfully obtain by request, purchase, or observation.". Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) is therefore gathering of intelligence that is lawfully available to the public. 

\subsection{Structure of report}
