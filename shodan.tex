It is possible to make a up to 5 queries using Shodan without registering an account. 
With a free account, it is possible to perform more queries, access to the Shodan API, and limited access to search filters. However, without a paid account, the website can has limited use.
Using the API, a free user can access up to 100 results from searches. 
For paid users, there are three payment plans: Freelancer, Small Business and Corporate. A Freelancer user get access to up to 1 million results per month and access to most search filters. 
Users paying for the higher tiers can get from 20 million to unlimited amount of results, all search filters and multiple extra benefits. 
1 million results per month will be sufficient for the scope of this project.
