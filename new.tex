\subsection{Crawlers and banners}\todo{Add a more complete example, when it is payed properly}
Shodan have bots called "crawlers" to find information about internet connected devices. These crawlers will continuously scan random ports of random IP addresses. If the port is open, the crawler will gather all the information it can about the port and IP, and save it. This can be properties such as IP address, port number, country, service running, version, protocols used, and more. 
All these properties are saved in Shodan "banners"\todo{er dette ein god måte å introdusere eit fagord på? Treng eg referere til \cref{app:dictionary}?} . The creator of Shodan, John Matherly has described banners as "A banner is simply metadata about a service.". \cite{banner} 
Therefore, when a user start a search using the Shodan search engine, it will not return live results, but rather the banners already saved in the Shodan database. Shodan guarantees that returned banners is collected in the last 30 days. 
Some of the Shodan banner properties are always on banners, while others are situational. For example will SSL properties only occur on banners of ports that use SSL encryption. A complete list of both required and situational Shodan banner properties can be found in \cref{app:banner_properties}.
Normally, the banners are in the JSON format. An example of a banner can be found in \cref{app:marlink_banner}.


\subsection{Search filters} \label{sec:filters}
To limit the results returned from a Shodan query, filters are applied. Filters are on the format:
\begin{lstlisting}
filter_property: value
\end{lstlisting}
When using a filter, Shodan queries will return banners where the properties specified in the filter contain the specified value. In most cases, filter properties correspond with banners. However, some filter properties are not banner properties. For example can the "geo" filter property define an area. The Shodan query will then return all banners where the "location.latitude" and "location.longitude" properties is within this banner. A complete list of Shodan filter properties can be found in \cref{app:shodan_filters}.


\todo{define Shodan Queries}


A comprehensive list of the Shodan filters can be found in \cref{app:shodan_filters}, . The queries used in this project will be explained in more detail. 

Add something about RegEx, and other search methods here.
