\subsubsection{Evaluation of the ability of the Shodan search engine to identify Internet-facing industrial control devices}
Evaluation of the ability of the Shodan search engine to identify Internet-facing industrial control devices gives a good overview of how Shodan works, with an explanation of the Shodan process for indexing webpages.\cite{bodenheim_butts_dunlap_mullins_2014} In addition, it shows how shodan can be used to search for Industrial Control Devices(ICS). A lot of those ICS will be used in the offshore industry, and some in the maritime industry. However, it is a search than what my report will use.
Lastly, the report shows that obfuscating devices make them hadder to find using Shodan.
