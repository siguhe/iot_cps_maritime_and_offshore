\subsubsection{NAT}
Due to NAT connecting devices to the internet trough a single router, Shodan will only scan the outer NAT routing device, and not the devices behind the NAT. NAT is not always used for getting more IPv4 addresses. Sometimes it is used purposely to hide IPv4 addresses from the public internet.

\subsubsection{firewalls}
